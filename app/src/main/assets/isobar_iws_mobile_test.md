# Isobar IWS Mobile Test
___

Hello! If you are reading this, it means that you want to join us! This is awesome, and also a great opportunity for you to blow us away with your coding skills.

- So here’s the deal: 
1. Do as much as you can and don’t rush to finish everything. 
2. Give it your best.

If you are ok with that, here’s the test (buckle up!):

#### Create a project to complete the 3 required phases below:

##### Phase 1
* Display a list of bands from a given json file: `bands.json`, which contains a band name and a band id.
* Try to make it look nice and fancy!

##### Phase 2
* Now that you have a list of bands, use the `id` to request the band details and present the band details in a separate screen.
* Here goes the bands details endpoint: ``https://powerful-oasis-33182.herokuapp.com/bands/{id}`
* Just like phase 1, try to make it look great!

##### Phase 3
* Make the data available offline. 

##### Finish
* Return your source code in 3 hours after you received theses instructions. Not a minute more. 

##### Last but not least
* We are looking for responsible people. Please DO NOT share this test or any information about it. 

We wish you good luck!
